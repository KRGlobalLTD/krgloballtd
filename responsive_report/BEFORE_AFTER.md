# Mobile Responsive Adjustments

## Navigation (Header)
- **Before:** Social links crowded header on small screens; no mobile menu.
- **After:** Social links hidden on mobile with a new accessible menu button opening a vertical drawer. Header container now uses consistent padding and higher z-index.

## Hero
- **Before:** Hero section forced `min-h-screen`; video wrapper had fixed heights and caused horizontal padding issues.
- **After:** Min height removed on mobile, container standardized, video wrapper uses fluid sizing with `object-cover` and padding, ensuring no overflow.

## About Section
- **Before:** Custom max-width container and large gaps created layout issues on narrow screens.
- **After:** Standard `container` sizing with adaptive grid gaps and fluid typography for heading and paragraph.

## Orbiting Labels
- **Before:** Labels positioned absolutely around the planet on all breakpoints, causing overlap on small devices.
- **After:** On mobile, labels stack vertically with 44px touch targets while orbital animation persists on larger screens.

## Footer
- **Before:** Flex layout could wrap awkwardly and email text could overflow.
- **After:** Responsive grid layout with truncated email link and consistent padding; social links remain accessible.
